# Test Implementation Plan for CL Application

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for end-to-end testing and validation of the CL application, which consists of a Node.js backend and a TypeScript/React frontend. The goal is to create automated test routines that validate all features and fix known bugs.

## Test Environment Setup

### Backend Testing Environment
- Jest testing framework configured with `jest.config.js`
- Test database configuration in `.env.test`
- Mock AWS services for testing AWS integrations
- Supertest for API testing

### Frontend Testing Environment
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking

## Test Implementation

### Backend Tests

#### 1. Authentication Tests (`auth.test.ts`)
- Test user login with valid credentials
- Test user login with invalid credentials
- Test user registration

#### 2. Campaign Tests (`campaign.test.ts`)
- Test campaign creation
- Test Excel file upload and processing
- Verify data loading into temp tables

#### 3. AI Research Tests (`ai-research.test.ts`)
- Test AI research process for a campaign
- Test committing research results to permanent tables
- Verify data transfer between temp and permanent tables

#### 4. Phone Calling Tests (`phone-calling.test.ts`)
- Test getting Amazon Connect credentials
- Test initiating a call to a buyer
- Test ending an active call
- Test fetching call history
- Test fetching call details

### Frontend Tests

#### 1. Login Tests (`login.cy.ts`)
- Test login form display
- Test login with invalid credentials
- Test login with valid credentials
- Test navigation to registration page

#### 2. Campaign Setup Tests (to be implemented)
- Test campaign setup form
- Test Excel file upload
- Test campaign data display

#### 3. AI Research Tests (to be implemented)
- Test AI research page navigation
- Test research process
- Test results display

#### 4. Profiles AI Page Tests (to be implemented)
- Test navigation between buyer profiles
- Test display of buyer details
- Test call script display

#### 5. Phone Calling Tests (to be implemented)
- Test Amazon Connect integration
- Test call initiation
- Test call termination
- Test call history display

## Bug Fixing Strategy

### 1. AWS Credentials Issue
- Problem: AWS credentials not loading properly from .env file
- Fix: Update credential loading mechanism to properly read from environment variables
- Test: Verify AWS service calls succeed with mock credentials

### 2. Database Transfer Issue
- Problem: Data not getting transferred properly to permanent tables
- Fix: Debug and fix the data transfer process in the commit-to-db endpoint
- Test: Verify all data is correctly transferred from temp to permanent tables

### 3. UI Button Positioning
- Problem: Blue button should be above the phone buttons, not among them
- Fix: Update CSS/component structure to position the button correctly
- Test: Visual verification and component tests

### 4. Green Button Reliability
- Problem: Green Button for API call is unreliable - works sometimes but not always
- Fix: Investigate API call process, add error handling and retry mechanism
- Test: Stress test the button functionality with multiple calls

### 5. Call History Feature
- Problem: Not working due to access credential issues
- Fix: Update AWS S3 access mechanism and error handling
- Test: Verify call history retrieval with mock data

## Test Execution Plan

1. Run backend unit tests
   ```
   cd cl-backendv4
   npm run test
   ```

2. Run frontend component tests
   ```
   cd cl-frontendv4
   npm run test
   ```

3. Run end-to-end tests
   ```
   cd cl-frontendv4
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

## Continuous Integration

For future implementation, we recommend setting up a CI/CD pipeline with:
- GitHub Actions or similar CI service
- Automated test runs on pull requests
- Test coverage reporting
- Deployment to staging environment after successful tests

## Conclusion

This test implementation plan provides a comprehensive approach to validating the CL application's functionality and fixing known issues. By following this plan, we can ensure that all features work as expected and that the application is ready for release to customers.
